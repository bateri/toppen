# Releasing

toppen is released as five files on a GitHub release tagged `v<x.y.z>` here: the program for
macOS on Apple silicon (`arm64`) and for Linux on `arm64` and `x86_64`, named
`toppen-<version>-<target>`, a `SHA256SUMS` that names the three, and an `app.json` with its
signature `app.json.sig`, which a terminal that follows toppen reads (pencere's `apps.md`). There is no Intel Mac file:
bateri, the terminal that shows the page, runs on Apple silicon only.
Every step a machine can check is in `tools/release.mjs`, behind the `make` targets below. This
file is the order of the steps and the reasons for them.

## Versions and the changelog

toppen follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). While it is `0.x`, a minor release
may change what the previous one did.

Every change a user would notice goes under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`
([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)), in the same commit as the change. A
release only moves that section under a version and a date; it does not write it.

## What a release needs

Each of the three files is the Rust program with its page (`src/view/`) and pictures
(`src/assets/`) carried in it, built by cargo for one target. So a release needs:

- Rust 1.99, the toolchain the gate runs with, on a machine of each target: a Mac on Apple silicon,
  and Linux on `arm64` and on `x86_64`, each with its target added (`rustup target add
  aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, and so on) and, on Linux, `musl-tools`. Each file is built where it
  runs, as textpen's are: no emulation and no cross toolchain.
- pencere as `Cargo.lock` takes it: cargo builds it into each file from that source, the commit of
  its repository `Cargo.toml` names. Nothing of pencere's is downloaded ready-made.
- Node, for `tools/release.mjs`: it is the one step of a release that is not cargo's.
- `gh`, logged in, to make the GitHub release.
- The signing key, on the maintainer's machine: `app.json` is signed with the key `pencere key`
  makes, kept in `~/.config/pencere/signing.key` (`PENCERE_SIGNING_KEY` names another file). It is
  the "bateri" key, the one bateri carries the public half of to follow toppen without asking:
  whoever has the file can release as toppen, so it is never committed and never on a machine
  that builds in a workflow, and it has a copy somewhere safe. A release signed with another key
  is a release bateri asks its people about.
- A `pencere` command that has `dist`, the one `Cargo.lock` takes: `make pencere` builds it
  (`PENCERE` names another).

A static Linux file cannot open NVIDIA's library at run time, so the NVIDIA cards are read only by a
build made on the machine; the README says so.

The files are built on the maintainers' machines and not by a workflow: an executable that a
workflow built is one that a pushed tag changes without a maintainer's decision. CI runs the gate
(`make check`) on Linux and macOS on every push and pull request; a release runs it again here.

## A release

From a clean `main`:

1. `make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0` sets the version in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` (the
   program says that version: `toppen --version`), and turns `## [Unreleased]` into
   `## [0.2.0] - <today>` with a new, empty `## [Unreleased]` above it. Read the diff, then commit it
   as `Release toppen 0.2.0`.
2. From that commit, on a clean tree, on a machine of each target: `make dist
   TARGET=<target>`, which builds `dist/release/toppen-0.2.0-<target>`. Gather the three in
   `dist/release` on the machine that releases, then `make sums` writes `SHA256SUMS`, and with
   `pencere dist` the `app.json` and `app.json.sig`: what the program needs of a terminal is not
   typed, `pencere dist` starts the file of this machine's target and reads what it says, and the
   earlier releases that `app.json` lists come from the `app.json` of the release before (the
   latest on GitHub; `DIST_FLAGS="--previous <file>"` names another, `--previous none` is for a
   first release). The file names carry the version, so a `dist/release` built before the version moved is refused; nothing can
   tell which source a file of the right version was built from, so build them after the commit
   and not before.
3. `make release` runs the gate (`make check`; `make fake-host` builds the stand-in terminal its
   tests play toppen in), then the release checks, then makes the annotated tag `v0.2.0` with the
   changelog section as its message. Nothing is pushed.
4. `make publish` pushes `main` and the tag in one atomic push, then makes the GitHub release
   with the changelog section as its notes and the five files.
5. Check it: `gh release view v0.2.0`.

If a check fails, nothing has left the machine: fix it, amend or add a commit, and run the step
again. A tag that was made but not pushed can be deleted with `git tag -d <tag>`. A pushed tag is
never moved; a broken release is followed by a new version. If the push went and `gh` failed, the
tag is on `origin` and the release is not: make it by hand with `gh release create v0.2.0
--verify-tag` and the files of `dist/release`.

### What the release checks refuse

- a version that is not after the last, or a `Cargo.toml` that disagrees with the newest changelog
  section;
- an `## [Unreleased]` section that still holds changes, or an empty release section;
- a branch other than `main`, a working tree that is not clean, a `main` that has diverged from
  `origin/main`;
- a tag that already exists, here or on `origin`, or a release that already exists on GitHub;
- a `dist/release` that is not exactly the three files of this version, `SHA256SUMS`, `app.json` and
  `app.json.sig`, with the sum of each as listed, or whose executable for this machine does not say
  this version;
- an `app.json` that its signature does not belong to (by the key it names), that is signed with
  another key than the "bateri" key (a published release cannot be taken back, and every bateri
  would turn it away), that is of another app or version, that does not name exactly the three targets at addresses ending in the files'
  names, or whose sums are not those of `SHA256SUMS`.

## Who releases

`make publish` makes the release under the project's name. Only a maintainer runs it. Everything
before it (prepare, commit, dist, tag) can be undone locally.
